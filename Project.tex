\section*{Abstract}
[Write a brief summary of your project here.]

\section{Part 1: Colley Method}
\subsection{Explanation}
Colley's method is used to rank sports teams based on their win-loss ratio.
The method was created by Wesley Colley to handle situations where teams may 
not have played each other an equal number of times. ]

\subsection{Laplace's Rule of Succession}
Laplace's Rule of Succession provides a formula to relate observed 
instances to unobserved ones, formally reffered to as "enumerative induction." 
The formula for probability is (k+1)/(n+2). Where 'k' is the number of times an event has occured, and 'n' is the total number of trials. 
In sports ranking, Laplace's rule provides a more accurate probabilty result for small data sets by accounting for future outcomes. 
This is acheieved through the use of biases, +1 and +2. 
The bias also eases the jumps in ranking when the observed data, number of games played, is scarce.


\subsection{Example Calculation}
